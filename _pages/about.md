I am an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering. I work on algorithm development for rural smart grid systems at the Solarillion Foundation. My interests also include research in Computer Architecture and Parallel Computing.
