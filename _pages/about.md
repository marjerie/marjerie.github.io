Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am a student pursuing a Bachelor's degree focused in Electronics and Communications Engineering from SSN College of Engineering. I work on algorithm development for rural smart grid systems at the Solarillion Foundation. My interests also include research in Digital Design and Computer Architecture.
