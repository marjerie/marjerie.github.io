## Aim

Flight delays are an unavoidable risk that every passenger might have to face. They lead to confusion and frustration, not to mention irreparable damages caused by 
missed deadlines in some cases. These risks can be prepared for by developing a reliable flight delay prediction model. Thus the losses incurred can be reduced or mitigated.
The aim of the project is to model a two stage predictive machine learning engine to forecast the on-time performance of a flight from the considered datasets. 
The first stage is a classifier that determines whether a flight is delayed or not. The second stage is to use a regression algorithm to predict the amount of delay in minutes.

## Data Collection and Overview

The data under consideration was obtained from the official website of Bureau of Transportation Statistics, United States Department of Transportation. 
Details of flights that flew between 15 different airports were isolated over a period of five years, that is, from 2013-2017.
The airports considered were (airport codes):
1. ATL 
2. CLT 
3. DEN
4. DFW
5. EWR
6. IAH
7. JFK
8. LAS
9. LAX
10. MCO
11. MIA
12. ORD
13. PHX
14. SEA
15. SFO
