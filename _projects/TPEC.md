## Overview

*	Built an algorithm using Python to solve a multi-variable optimization problem to maximize the utilization of energy resources in a rural microgrid cluster.
*	Reduces cost of system by 11.3 percent and improves the efficiency by 4.9 percent.
*	Published in 2020 IEEE Texas Power and Energy Conference proceedings. [(here)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9042508) <br>
